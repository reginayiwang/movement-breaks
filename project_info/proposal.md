# Project Proposal

|  | Description | Answer |
| :---- | ----- | ----- |
| Stack Focus | Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application? | I’d like to have a balance of features developed on the back-end and a nice presentation on the front-end. |
| Type | Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else? | Website |
| Goal | What goal will your project be designed to achieve? | The goal is to create a timer for work breaks that provides exercises to encourage movement. The simplest version of this app would be a timer for a set period (maybe an hour) that users can start, pause and reset. When the timer goes off, a random selection of exercises will be provided for the user to do. Additional potential features that could be included as time allows: Customizable timer periods User accounts to save preferences  Guidance through exercises (such as timers for stretches and images or animations of exercises) Saving user history of work breaks User preferences for exercise types |
| Users | What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users? | The app would be targeted to users who work jobs in office-type settings that spend most of their day seated in front of a computer. Workers who have active jobs would have less need for an app like this. While ideally the app would allow for customization to meet a user’s specific mobility needs/restrictions, this is probably out of scope so it would be most useful for individuals without any major health/mobility issues that would be exacerbated through exercise.  |
| Data | Data What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. | The most important data source for this app will be the API that provides the exercises. There are several options including [this one](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb) which provides animations. I would like the  API used for the project to have a large database of exercises that could be selected from, and enough parameters to filter on, so it could be isolated to bodyweight exercises since most people will be doing these exercises near their desks, not in a gym.  For some of the stretch goals, it would be necessary to have my own database to store user accounts and potentially preferences and history.  |
