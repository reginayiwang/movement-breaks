* **Work Break Timer:** Sitting all day is not good for your health, and most people are not moving much while they work (or sometimes when they aren’t working too\!). This site would be a timer that would encourage focusing for a specified period of time, and then taking breaks to move a bit, which would be guided exercises pulled from an external API. Users would be able to customize their work/break lengths (some people like following the Pomodoro technique, some people like working for longer focused periods) and also potentially the recommended exercises (maybe you work at home and have access to equipment that most people don't have in an office).  
* **Meal Planner:** Users would be able to set their nutritional goals and generate recipe recommendations (from an external API) to build a meal planner that meets their needs. Ideally, they’d be able to set preferences for foods they like/dislike, food sensitivities so they can be avoided, etc.   
* **Improved Yelp ‘Surprise Me’:** I spend a lot of time debating with friends on where to go to eat. Yelp has a ‘Surprise Me’ feature but sometimes it recommends things that are closed, or things we are uninterested in. This site would be an improved ‘Surprise Me’ to make these plans between friends easier. People could have accounts with preference of their favorite and least favorite types of cuisines which would get factored into the recommendation. Downside: the Yelp API isn’t free, but it does have a free 30 day trial.
